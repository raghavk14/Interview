1. Tokens are SAML (Security Access Markup Language)
2. Once user provides user name and pwd the STS (Security Token Service) will be provided by IdP (Identity Providers), which is laden with claims and is digitally signed.
3. What information the claims contained in a token can have ?
	
	A claim can identify a user
	A claim can convey group or role memebership
	A claim can grant or deny the right oto do something e.g. Such as access particular info. or invoke specific methods
	A claim cna constrain the right to do something e.g. Such as indicating the user's purchasing limit

4. An application which entertains users with tokens, can accept token from either only one STS IdP for multiple. An enterprise application might entertain
   tokens from only one IdP but a public shopping website can entertain tokens from multiple IdPs (list of Trusted IdPs) such as facebook, google or Microsoft.
